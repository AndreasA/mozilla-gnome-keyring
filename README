An extension to enable passwords and form logins to be stored in gnome-keyring

This extension replaces the default password manager in both Firefox and
Thunderbird with an implementation which stores the passwords in Gnome keyring.

This allows for safe storage of passwords without prompting for password after
Firefox or Thunderbird has been started.

Notice: gnome-keyring stores the passwords encrypted on permanent storage but
it keeps passwords in memory without encryption. As a result, other programs
with access to memory space of gnome-keyring (namely debuggers and applications
running as root) may be able to extract the passwords. The same applies to
internal Firefox and Thunderbird implementations so use of this extension
should be any less secure than the default implementation. The passwords are
decrypted once the gnome keyring has been opened (if a gnome keyring has
identical password to your login password, it will be automatically opened once
you login). Your passwords are stored only in encrypted form any time you are
not logged in.
